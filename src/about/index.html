	<p>
		Mac grew up in Jackson, Michigan. Attending Michigan State University’s
		James Madison College, he graduated in 2003 with dual degrees in
		international relations and Russian language and literature. He worked in
		the financial services sector in New York for nearly a decade before moving
		back to Detroit in 2012.
	</p>

	<p>
		Starting in a volunteer position in Mike Duggan’s campaign in 2013, he
		started as a phone bank volunteer, and ended as finance director for the
		campaign. He joined the mayoral administration in 2014 and worked through
		the bankruptcy on operational restructuring, focusing on topics such as EMS
		response time, income tax collection, infrastructure and blight reduction.
		Since joining the Villages Community Development Corporation in 2015, he has
		raised over two million dollars, put forth a clear strategy to stabilize and
		grow our neighborhoods on the east side of Detroit, and pioneered new
		infrastructure and development work, including nagging the city to roll out
		speed humps and clear out alleys for years.

		Not knowing what he was doing, Mac bought a house in 2014, and moved to
		Pingree Park in 2019. In addition to his day job with the Villages CDC, he
		has renovated six houses in West Village, Indian Village and Pingree Park,
		and is looking to develop larger commercial project as well. Mac is
		currently the Vice President of the Pingree Park Association, executive
		director of the Villages Community Development Corporation, is a member of
		the Indian Village Tennis Club, the Detroit Athletic Club and Jefferson
		Avenue Presbyterian Church.
	</p>

	<p>
		Mac believes that Detroit deserves the same kind of services and
		infrastructure that other municipalities have to keep existing residents and
		attract new, that our politics is truly broken at almost every level of
		government, and that by focusing on peoples’ actual needs, rather than
		shouty identity politics, you can rebuild your community.
