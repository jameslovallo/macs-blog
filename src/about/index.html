    Mac was born in South Haven in the early 1980s and grew up in Jackson in the
    1990s. Graduating in 2003 from Michigan State University's James Madison
    College with dual degrees in international relations and Russian language
    and literature, Mac worked in the financial services sector in New York for
    nearly a decade before moving to Detroit in 2012.

    Starting in a volunteer position on Mike Duggan's initial campaign for mayor
    in 2013, Mac worked for the Mayor and the City for nearly three years,
    starting as a phone bank volunteer, finishing the campaign as finance
    director, and working through Detroit's Chapter 13 municipal bankruptcy in
    the area of operational restructuring. From working on projects related to
    income taxes to EMS response time to public lighting to infrastructure.

    Having lived on the east side since 2014, Mac has been a member and leader
    of the Indian Village Association (former board member), Pingree Park
    Association (founding President), Indian Village Tennis Club (current board
    member), employed by the Villages Community Development Corporation (current
    executive director), Jefferson Avenue Presbyterian Church (current member)
    and the Detroit Yacht Club (current member). His work in advocacy has
    directly led to the deployment of speed humps throughout Detroit, the
    clearing out of hundreds of alleys, and getting many different pieces of
    infrastructure fixed (sidewalks, trees, utility issues, etc.).

    By continuing to focus on outcomes and facts, Mac believes that we can
    continue to build a truly united and prosperous Detroit where differences of
    opinion are cause for collaboration, not recrimination.
